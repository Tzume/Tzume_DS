### The case we work with
We need to write a code which guesses the number by the minimum amount of attempt.

**Competion conditions:**
- The computer thinks of a number from 1 to 100, we have to guess it. "To guess" means to write a code which guesses the number;
- The algorithm considers the information if the random number is bigger ot smaller than the number the should guess.

**Quality metrics**
The results are evaluated by average amount of attempt during 1000 repeat.

**The subject for practice**
The aim to study who to write a good code in Python
