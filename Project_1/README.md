### The case we work with
We need to write a code which guesses the number by less than 20 attempt.

**Competion conditions:**
- The computer thinks of a number from 1 to 100, we have to guess it. "To guess" means to write a code which guesses the number;
- The algorithm considers the information if the random number is bigger or smaller than the number that we should guess.

**Quality metrics**
The results are evaluated by average amount of attempt during 1000 repeat.

**The subject for practice**
Practice of writing a good code in Python according to given conditions
Practice of working in IDE
Practice of working in GitHub
